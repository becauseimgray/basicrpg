This is a basic RPG created in Love2D. I'll be adding too it over time like most of my other projects.

TODO:

 Make the game object-oriented by designing a player.lua and entity.lua in order to save space.
 
 Design a thematic visual design for the game, so it doesn't look gross.
 
 Create a map.lua, which imports Tiled maps.
